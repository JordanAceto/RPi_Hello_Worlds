## The files in this directory follow the basic idea here: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/

### The code has been ported over to work on the Raspberry Pi 3b+.

### Some acronyms used:
- PSP: "Processor Support Package". Files that start with PSP support the processor, things like GPIO, Timebase Registers, etc. fall under PSP. Functions that are specific to the processor go here.
- BSP: "Board Suppert Package". Files that start with BSP support the physical circuitboard and peripherals installed on it. Empty for now.
