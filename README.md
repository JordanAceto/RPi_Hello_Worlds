## This is a repository of a few different hello world programs written for the Raspberry Pi 3b+

### The general idea is just to explore RPi concepts in the simplest possible way.

#### The directories are organized in order of complexity like this:
- simple_printing_hws: contains simple .py and .c files that print "hello "world"
- simple_blinking_hws: contains .py and .c files that blink an LED using gpio libraries
- complex_blinking_hws: contains .c files (and hopefully asm files in the future) that blink an LED without using gpio libraries

### This is just a scratchpad for ideas, not a complete or well thought out finished product 

### Here is the layout used for all LED blinking programs:
